# bash-fuck

## What is 'bash-fuck'?
bash-fuck is a new command introduced to linux.
You can install it on a bash shell and use it via the command `fuck`.

## Who should/could use that?
There are so many developers out there that have to fix bugs etc.
Whenever you, dear devs, have to fix a stupid bug again...
And you can find a solution...
And your rage slowly increases...
You now have a way to let that pressure out. Whenever your next build fails just write `fuck` inside a bash terminal and your rage will surely decrease again.

## Why did I create this script?
That's a question I'm kinda asking myself.
I guess I wrote it because I needed an output as well.
In the end it's one of those "just for fun"-projects. We'll see if I'll add more features in the future.

## Installation
To install this neat feature just download the project from [GitHub](https://github.com/Ruesa18/bash-fuck) or clone it.
After that you can run the `install.sh` script inside the project folder. This will automatically set you up with everything you need.
Note there's also a `uninstall.sh` which you can use if you ever wish to remove this command again.
